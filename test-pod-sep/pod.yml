Pod : Only one type in Kubernetes (smallest deployable unit).

Containers : Run inside a Pod, but they can have different roles (main, init, sidecar, etc).

So, containers â‰  pod types. They are just patterns inside a pod

containers: contaires are concept of k8s Run inside a Pod
main container : main application running means main container running on this 
init container: it is only configuration purpose  [velora tool for using eks backup]
Note: before side car defination you completly understand any application it has logs in that logs are 2 types access.log and error.log ex in nginx application inside cd /var/log/nginx
side-car container : logs fetching or pulling from main container i.e main running conatiners main application running  container
ambasedor container: is not important it means main container is running in your pod additional image configuration theory import
ephermal conatiner: its also not important theory import only debugging purpose using lets suppose this is shutdown data also lost 



# sidecar containers example
# ---------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sidecar-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main-container
      image: nginx # main container done
      volumeMounts: # go the inside of VolumeMounts
        - name: nginx-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx # nginx log path
# lets take another image busybox 
# side car container under conatiners
    - name: sidecar-container
      image: busybox
      args: ["bin/sh"]
      command: ["-c" , "tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log"]
# now main application errors we want busybox is lightweight thats wy using cmd 
# nginx logs attached with busybox thats why we are using volumeMounts
# this write in before sidecar-container
# volumeMounts is also a array it is inside of containers
# now mount 
      volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx #this is main container path it is mount to main container
          # in real time this way using 
         
  volumes:
    - name: nginx-logs
      emptyDir: {}        

note:this will be after running side showing pod status crashloopbackof work is same every time k8s create the pod but mage is showing `like crashloopbackupoff just showing loggs by using 
kubectl logs sidecar-pod -c sidecar-container
